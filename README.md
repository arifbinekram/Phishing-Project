#### Overview
The Phishing-Project by arifbinekram is designed to simulate a phishing attack for educational purposes. It involves a simple web page that prompts users to enter their email address and password. This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding how phishing works, using HTML, JavaScript, and Python.

#### Components
1. **example.html**: A mock login page that captures email and password inputs.
2. **server.py**: A Python server script that processes the data received from the HTML form.

#### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the phishing page.
- **JavaScript**: Manages interaction on the client-side, captures user input.
- **Python**: Backend script to handle the HTTP requests and print credentials to the console.

#### Running the Project
To run this project:
1. Launch the Python server using `server.py`.
2. Open `example.html` in a web browser.
3. Input credentials and observe how they are logged by the server.

This project is purely for educational purposes to demonstrate the mechanism of phishing attacks and is not intended for any malicious use.
